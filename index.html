        <p>Projects showcasing data analytics skills: collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting—directly relevant to BRG's internship responsibilities like identifying trends, supporting decisions, and automating processes.</p>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Library Management System – Python (Summer 2024)</h3>
            <p>Built a full-stack system for managing library data (books, patrons, loans) using OOP. Handled data entry, tracking fines/loans, and generating reports. Deployed as a web app with Flask for interactive data queries and visualizations—simulating real-world data analytics for inventory optimization and user insights.</p>

            <pre><code># Sample Python Code: Data Analysis Snippet
import pandas as pd

# Simulate loading loan data for analysis
loans = pd.read_json('library_data.json')['loans']
overdue = loans[loans['status'] == 'overdue']
print(overdue.describe())  # Summary stats for trends
